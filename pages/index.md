I am passionate about finding cool ideas in daily development and implementing them. I think it's very meaningful to extract complex code and encapsulate it into reusable tools. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects). 

For my own open source project ideas, I always write [blogs](/blogs) about my journey and experiences.

When I have free time, such as on weekends or while commuting on the subway, I always browse the open-source community. You can read my [notes on new knowledge here](/notes).
